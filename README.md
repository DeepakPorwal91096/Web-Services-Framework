Web Application Frameworks are server-side software frameworks designed to enhance the development, maintenance, and scalability of web applications. These frameworks offer a suite of tools and libraries that streamline various web development tasks. In the context of web communication, servers and browsers interact via the HTTP protocol, with servers responding to HTTP requests from browsers.



Web Application Frameworks provide the advantage of employing simplified syntax, which automatically generates server-side code to handle these requests and responses. Consequently, developers benefit from working with higher-level, more accessible code, rather than getting involved in intricate low-level networking primitives. By leveraging these frameworks, developers can streamline their workflow and focus on the core functionality and features of their web applications.
